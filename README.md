# WIP: Nofeed

Feeds are great. But they are overwhelming, infinite and scream for your attention. It is slightly better to take an active role in consuming content. 

Nofeed forces you to curate your own content:

- Subscribe to only the channels you love on YouTube
- Use lists to limit the people you follow on Twitter
